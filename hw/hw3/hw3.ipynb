A side advantage of this would be that with a bigger test split, we'll have a more reliable estimate of the model performance!_"

    "| workclass | imputation, one-hot encoding | workclass is a categorical feature with missing values. We impute missing values with the most frequent category, then apply one-hot encoding to convert categories into separate binary features. |\n",
    "| fnlwgt | drop | fnlwgt (final weight) represents a census calculation that's not directly interpretable or useful for our predictive task, hence it's dropped. |\n",
    "| education | ordinal encoding | Education represents ordered categories (e.g., HS-grad < Some-college < Bachelors), hence ordinal encoding is applied to preserve this order in numeric form. |\n",
    "| education.num | drop | Education.num is a numerical representation of 'education' and is redundant since we are already considering 'education'. Therefore, it is dropped. |\n",
    "| marital.status | one-hot encoding  | Marital.status is a categorical feature without order, so we apply one-hot encoding to convert each category into a separate binary feature. |\n",
    "| occupation | imputation, one-hot encoding  | Occupation is a categorical feature with missing values. We impute the missing values and then apply one-hot encoding to handle this categorical feature. |\n",
    "| relationship | one-hot encoding  | Relationship is a categorical feature without order, hence one-hot encoding is applied to convert each category into a separate binary feature. |\n",
    "| race | drop  | Race is dropped to avoid potential biases in our model predictions. |\n",
    "| sex | one-hot encoding with \"binary=True\" | Sex is a binary feature that only contains two categories. It's one-hot encoded and one category is dropped to prevent duplicate information. |\n",
    "| capital.gain | scaling | Capital.gain is a numeric feature. Scaling is used to standardize the range of its values.  | \n",
    "| capital.loss | scaling | Capital.loss is also a numeric feature. Scaling standardizes its range of values.  |\n",
    "| hours.per.week | scaling | Hours.per.week is a numeric feature, which represents the number of hours worked per week. Scaling is applied to standardize the range of its values. |\n",

    "1. The problem with calling `fit_transform` on test data with `StandardScaler` is that it leads to inconsistent scaling between the training and test data, introducing data leakage and potentially producing incorrect predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Following the Golden Rule is important because it ensures unbiased evaluation of a model's performance on unseen data. Violating the Golden Rule by using test data during training can result in overfitting and a worse classifier due to the lack of generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Two advantages of using sklearn Pipelines are:\n",
    "   - Convenience and Readability: Pipelines allow for the seamless integration of multiple preprocessing steps and the final model into a single object, enhancing code organization and readability.\n",
    "   - Data Leakage Prevention: Pipelines ensure that all preprocessing steps are applied solely to the training data during cross-validation and deployment, preventing information from the test data or future data from influencing the training process and leading to more reliable model evaluation and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. sklearn `ColumnTransformer` is appropriate when you have a dataset with different types of features that require distinct preprocessing steps. It allows for the application of specific transformations to specific subsets of features, streamlining the preprocessing workflow and maintaining consistency and efficiency in handling diverse feature types."
